# CTR_Prediction-for-email-Campaigns
Problem Statement

Most organizations today rely on email campaigns for effective communication with users. Email communication is one of the popular ways to pitch products to users and build trustworthy relationships with them.

Email campaigns contain different types of CTA (Call To Action). The ultimate goal of email campaigns is to maximize the Click Through Rate (CTR).

CTR is a measure of success for email campaigns. The higher the click rate, the better your email marketing campaign is. CTR is calculated by the no. of users who clicked on at least one of the CTA divided by the total no. of users the email was delivered to.

CTR = No. of users who clicked on at least one of the CTA / No. of emails delivered

CTR depends on multiple factors like design, content, personalization, etc.

How do you design the email content effectively? What should your subject line look like? What should be the length of the email? Do you need images in your email template?
